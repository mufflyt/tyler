genderize_physicians(
  input_csv,
  output_dir = NULL,
  output_format = c("csv", "parquet")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_csv}{The path to the input roster file. CSV and Parquet sources are
supported.}

\item{output_dir}{The directory where the output file will be saved. Default
is a session-specific folder inside \code{\link[=tempdir]{tempdir()}}.}

\item{output_format}{Output format for the saved roster. Either "csv" or
"parquet" with "csv" as the default to preserve backwards compatibility.}
}
\value{
A data frame with genderized information joined to the original data.

The function queries the \href{https://genderize.io}{Genderize.io} API for first
name gender predictions. First names are deduplicated before querying the
service to minimise repeated requests.
}
\description{
This function reads a CSV file containing physician data, genderizes the first names,
and joins the gender information back to the original data. It then saves the
result to a new CSV file with a timestamp.
