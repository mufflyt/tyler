\description{
This function reads a CSV file containing physician data, genderizes the first names,
and joins the gender information back to the original data. It then saves the
result to a new CSV file with a timestamp. The function calls the
\href{https://genderize.io}{Genderize.io} API to obtain gender predictions for
deduplicated first names, adds the returned probability and count information,
and requires an active internet connection.
