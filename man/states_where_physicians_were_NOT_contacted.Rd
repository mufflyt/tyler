\title{Summarize States Where Physicians Were NOT Contacted}
\usage{
states_where_physicians_were_NOT_contacted(filtered_data, all_states = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_data}{A data frame containing filtered data of contacted physicians.}

\item{all_states}{A character vector of all possible states including Washington, DC.
If not provided, a default set of states will be used.}
}
\value{
A character string summarizing the inclusion and exclusion of states along with the
count of unique physicians successfully contacted.
}
\description{
This function summarizes the demographic details by identifying the states where physicians
were not successfully contacted and those that were included. It also reports how many unique
physicians were reached by filtering to rows with affirmative contact indicators (for example,
\code{\"Yes\"} values in \code{contact_office} or \code{included_in_study}).
