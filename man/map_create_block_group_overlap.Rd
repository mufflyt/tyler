\title{Function to create and export a map showing block group overlap with isochrones}
\usage{
map_create_block_group_overlap(
  bg_data,
  isochrones_data,
  output_dir = "figures/"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bg_data}{An \code{sf} polygon object representing block group data in EPSG:4326.}

\item{isochrones_data}{An \code{sf} polygon object representing isochrone data with a
drive-time column expressed in minutes.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory path for exporting the map files. Default is "figures/".}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
This function creates a map that displays block groups and their overlap with
isochrones. Polygons are repaired and oriented before plotting, and the
isochrones are unioned and rendered from the longest drive time (red 180 minute
zones) to the shortest (blue 30 minute zones) so shorter travel bands always
appear on top.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create and export the map with the default output directory
map_create_block_group_overlap(block_groups, isochrones_joined_map)

# Create and export the map with a custom output directory
map_create_block_group_overlap(block_groups, isochrones_joined_map, "custom_output/")
}
