\title{Calculate intersection overlap and save results to shapefiles.}
\usage{
calculate_intersection_overlap_and_save(
  block_groups,
  isochrones_joined,
  drive_time_minutes,
  output_dir,
  crosswalk = NULL,
  notify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_groups}{An sf object representing block groups.}

\item{isochrones_joined}{An sf object representing isochrones.}

\item{drive_time_minutes}{The drive time value (in minutes) for which to calculate the
intersection.}

\item{output_dir}{The directory where the intersection shapefile will be saved.}

\item{crosswalk}{Optional function used to translate ACS block groups between the 2010
and 2020 vintages when the provider \code{data_year} and ACS \code{vintage}
columns disagree. The function receives the sf object and a list containing
\code{from} and \code{to} years and must return an sf object whose \code{vintage}
column matches the provider year.}

\item{notify}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, play a notification sound on completion when the optional \pkg{beepr}
package is available. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
None. The function saves the intersection shapefile and provides logging.
}
\description{
This function calculates the intersection between block groups and isochrones for a specific drive time and saves the results to a shapefile.  Areas are measured after reprojecting both datasets to an equal-area coordinate reference system for accuracy. Provider and ACS vintages must match; if a 2010/2020 mismatch is detected, users must supply a \code{crosswalk} to perform the translation. Isochrone polygons are unioned before intersection so overlapping catchments are treated once, and the resulting outputs record the area measurement method that was used.
