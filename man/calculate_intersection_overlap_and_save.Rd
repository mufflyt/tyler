\title{Calculate intersection overlap and save results to shapefiles.}
\usage{
calculate_intersection_overlap_and_save(
  block_groups,
  isochrones_joined,
  drive_time_minutes,
  output_dir,
  crosswalk = NULL,
  notify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_groups}{An sf object representing block groups.}

\item{isochrones_joined}{An sf object representing isochrones.}

\item{drive_time_minutes}{The drive time value (in minutes) for which to calculate the
intersection.}

\item{output_dir}{The directory where the intersection shapefile will be saved.}

\item{crosswalk}{Optional function used to translate ACS geographies between
2010 and 2020 definitions. When supplied, it should accept two arguments:
an sf object and a named list with \code{from} and \code{to} years, returning an sf
object whose \code{vintage} column matches the provider \code{data_year}.}

\item{notify}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, play a notification sound on completion when
the optional \code{beepr} package is available. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
None. The function saves the intersection shapefile and provides logging.
}
\description{
This function calculates the intersection between block groups and isochrones for a specific drive time and saves the results to a shapefile.  To
ensure accurate area-based calculations, both datasets are temporarily
projected to an equal-area CRS before measuring.
