\description{
Provides a resilient download helper that prefers \code{wget} with continuation support, falling back to \code{curl} and then base R's \code{download.file()}. Downloads are written to a temporary \code{.download} file and moved to the requested destination once the transfer is complete. A lightweight lock file prevents concurrent downloads of the same target path.
