#' Volatile audit fields excluded from artifact_id computation
#'
#' The canonical list of audit JSON fields that change between runs and are
#' therefore excluded when computing `artifact_id`. Any field that appears here
#' must NOT influence the content-addressable identity of an artifact.
#'
#' Keeping this constant in one place ensures that `mysterycall_verify_artifact()`
#' and `mysterycall_clean_phase1()` use identical canonicalization logic.

#' Verify the content-addressable identity of an audit trail JSON file
#'
#' Loads an audit JSON written by [mysterycall_clean_phase1()], strips the
#' volatile fields, recomputes the SHA-256 digest of the stable payload, and
#' compares it against the stored `artifact_id`. A mismatch means the file was
#' modified after it was written or the `artifact_id` was computed with
#' different logic.
#'
#' @param audit_path Character scalar. Path to an `audit_trail_*.json` file.
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns `TRUE` if verification passes. Throws an
#'   informative error if verification fails or the file cannot be parsed.
#'
#' @section Contract:
#' **Inputs:**
#' - `audit_path` must point to a readable JSON file produced by
#'   [mysterycall_clean_phase1()] at schema version >= 1.2.0.
#'
#' **Guarantees:**
#' - Returns `TRUE` (invisibly) only when `artifact_id` matches the recomputed
#'   digest. Any other outcome raises an error with a diagnostic message.
#' - Never modifies the audit file.
#'
#' **Fails if:**
#' - `audit_path` does not exist or is not valid JSON.
#' - The file was produced by a schema version prior to 1.2.0 (no `artifact_id`).
#' - The recomputed digest does not match the stored `artifact_id`.
