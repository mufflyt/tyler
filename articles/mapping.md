# Visualizing Provider Geographic Data

## Overview

The `mysterycall` package provides a family of mapping functions for
visualizing physician geographic data across the United States. These
functions cover interactive Leaflet maps centered on ACOG district
boundaries, static ggplot2 maps of Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs), and
overlap maps that combine drive-time isochrones with Census block
groups. Use them to communicate where providers practice, how they are
distributed across professional districts, and which communities fall
within a given drive-time catchment area.

## Base map

[`map_create_base()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
returns a [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) map object
pre-configured for US provider mapping. It includes two tile-layer
options — **CartoDB Voyager** (a clean, labeled street map) and **Stadia
Toner Lite** (a minimal black-and-white style) — selectable via a
layer-control widget in the top-right corner. A scale bar is added at
the bottom-left. An optional `title` argument accepts an HTML string
that is placed in a control panel at the top-left of the map.

``` r

library(mysterycall)
library(leaflet)

# Default view: continental United States, zoom 4
map_create_base()

# With a custom HTML title
map_create_base(title = "<strong>Ob-Gyn Provider Map</strong>")

# Zoom in on a specific region
map_create_base(
  title = "Mountain West",
  lat   = 39.5,
  lng   = -111.0,
  zoom  = 6
)
```

The returned leaflet object can be piped into any additional
`leaflet::add*()` calls to layer physician points, isochrone polygons,
or district boundaries on top of the base tiles.

## ACOG district boundaries

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) divides
the United States into eleven geographic districts that govern regional
governance and continuing-education activities.
[`map_create_acog_districts_sf()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
joins the packaged `ACOG_Districts` lookup table to Natural Earth state
geometries and returns a dissolved `sf` polygon object — one row per
district — that is ready for mapping or spatial joins.

``` r

library(mysterycall)

# Build the sf object (requires rnaturalearth)
districts_sf <- map_create_acog_districts_sf()

# Inspect the result
class(districts_sf)
#> [1] "sf"         "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

names(districts_sf)
#> [1] "ACOG_District"      "Subregion"          "States"
#> [4] "State_Abbreviations" "geometry"

print(districts_sf[, c("ACOG_District", "States")], n = 5)
```

The bundled `ACOG_Districts` data frame contains the underlying
state-to-district mapping and can be inspected without building the sf
object:

``` r

library(mysterycall)

data(ACOG_Districts)
head(ACOG_Districts)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 4
#>   State      ACOG_District Subregion     State_Abbreviations
#>   <chr>      <chr>         <chr>         <chr>              
#> 1 Alabama    District VII  District VII  AL                 
#> 2 Alaska     District VIII District VIII AK                 
#> 3 Arizona    District VIII District VIII AZ                 
#> 4 Arkansas   District VII  District VII  AR                 
#> 5 California District IX   District IX   CA                 
#> 6 Colorado   District VIII District VIII CO
```

The table below summarises how many states each district covers:

``` r

data(ACOG_Districts)
dist_summary <- aggregate(State ~ ACOG_District, data = ACOG_Districts, FUN = length)
names(dist_summary)[2] <- "n_states"
dist_summary <- dist_summary[order(dist_summary$ACOG_District), ]
knitr::kable(
  dist_summary,
  col.names = c("ACOG District", "States"),
  caption   = "Number of US states (and territories) in each ACOG district.",
  row.names = FALSE
)
```

| ACOG District | States |
|:--------------|-------:|
| District I    |      6 |
| District II   |      1 |
| District III  |      2 |
| District IV   |      9 |
| District IX   |      1 |

dist_counts$ACOG_District <- factor(
  dist_counts$ACOG_District,
  levels = dist_counts$ACOG_District[order(dist_counts$n_states)]
)

ggplot2::ggplot(dist_counts,

## Physician dot map

[`map_create_physician_dot()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
builds an interactive Leaflet dot map from a data frame that contains
`lat`, `long`, `name`, and `ACOG_District` columns. It layers ACOG
district boundaries in red, colors each physician dot according to their
district using the viridis `"magma"` palette (configurable via
`color_palette`), adds a small random jitter to overlapping points, and
saves the result as a self-contained HTML file plus a PNG screenshot to
`output_dir`.

``` r

library(mysterycall)

# Synthetic provider data — replace with your own data frame
physician_data <- data.frame(
  long          = c(-95.363, -97.743, -98.494, -96.900, -95.370,
                    -87.623, -122.431, -73.935, -84.388, -104.990),
  lat           = c( 29.763,  30.267,  29.424,  32.779,  29.752,
                     41.883,  37.774,  40.730,  33.749,  39.739),
  name          = paste("Physician", 1:10),
  ACOG_District = c(
    "District VII", "District VII", "District VII", "District VII", "District VII",
    "District IV",  "District IX",  "District II",  "District IV",  "District VIII"
  )
)

# Create the dot map and save HTML + PNG to a temporary directory
map_create_physician_dot(
  physician_data = physician_data,
  jitter_range   = 0.05,
  color_palette  = "magma",
  popup_var      = "name",
  output_dir     = tempdir()
)
```

The function invisibly returns the leaflet map object so you can inspect
or extend it. Requires the `leaflet`, `viridis`, `htmlwidgets`, and
`webshot` packages; install PhantomJS with
[`webshot::install_phantomjs()`](http://wch.github.io/webshot/reference/install_phantomjs.md)
before the first use.

## Hospital Referral Regions

Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) are the 306 geographic units defined by
the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care to represent regional health care
markets for tertiary services.
[`hrr()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
downloads the official shapefile (~8 MB) from the Dartmouth Atlas on
first use, caches it in the user’s R cache directory, and returns an
`sf` object in CRS 4326. By default Hawaii and Alaska are excluded; set
`remove_HI_AK = FALSE` to retain all regions.

``` r

library(mysterycall)
library(ggplot2)

hrr_sf <- hrr(remove_HI_AK = TRUE)

# Quick look at the object
glimpse(hrr_sf)
```

The returned sf object can be passed directly to
[`ggplot2::geom_sf()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html)
for static publication-ready maps:

``` r

ggplot(hrr_sf) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#f0f0f0", color = "#999999", linewidth = 0.15) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Hospital Referral Regions — Continental United States")
```

[`hrr_generate_maps()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
extends this by overlaying a physician sf object onto a hexagonal grid,
producing a count-per-cell choropleth with Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto
Rico insets. The result is saved as both TIFF and PNG at journal-ready
resolution (600 dpi by default).

``` r

# physician_sf must be an sf object with point geometries
hrr_generate_maps(
  physician_sf = physician_sf,
  trait_map    = "obgyn",
  honey_map    = "all",
  output_dir   = tempdir(),
  dpi          = 300,
  width        = 7,
  height       = 5
)
```

## Block group overlap maps

After running
[`create_isochrones_for_dataframe()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
and
[`calculate_intersection_overlap_and_save()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md),
you will have two sf objects: one with Census block group polygons
(containing an `overlap` column — the proportion of each block group
within the isochrone) and one with drive-time isochrone polygons
(containing a `drive_time` column). Pass both to
[`map_create_block_group_overlap()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
to produce an interactive Leaflet map that shades block groups by their
overlap proportion and draws each isochrone (30 / 60 / 120 / 180
minutes) in a distinct color. The map is exported as an HTML file and a
PNG screenshot to `output_dir`.

``` r

library(mysterycall)

# bg_data and isochrones_data are sf objects produced by the isochrone workflow
map_create_block_group_overlap(
  bg_data        = bg_data,
  isochrones_data = isochrones_data,
  output_dir     = tempdir()
)
```

For details on generating `bg_data` and `isochrones_data`, see the
[`vignette("create_isochrones", package = "mysterycall")`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/articles/create_isochrones.md)
vignette.
