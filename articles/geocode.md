# Geocoding

## Overview

The `geocode` function is designed to help you geocode datasets
containing addresses and change them to latitude and longitude.

### Step 1

#### Installation

Before you can harness the power of the `mysterycall_search_by_taxonomy`
function, it is essential to ensure that you have the `mysterycall`
package installed. You can effortlessly install it using the following
command:

``` r

library(mysterycall)
```

## Example Usage

### Understanding Geocoding

Certainly! Geocoding, the process of converting addresses or place names
into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), has its advantages
and disadvantages. Here’s an overview of the pluses and minuses of
geocoding:

**Pluses of Geocoding:**

- 1.  **Location Accuracy:** Geocoding provides precise location
      information, allowing you to pinpoint addresses or places on a map
      with high accuracy. This is crucial for various applications such
      as mapping, navigation, and location-based services.
- 2.  **Spatial Analysis:** Geocoded data enables spatial analysis,
      allowing you to perform tasks like proximity analysis, spatial
      clustering, and spatial interpolation. It’s invaluable for
      geographic information systems (GIS) and geographic research.
- 3.  **Geographic Visualization:** Geocoded data can be visualized on
      maps, making it easier to understand and communicate spatial
      patterns and trends. This is particularly useful for data
      presentation and decision-making.
- 4.  **Routing and Navigation:** Geocoding is essential for navigation
      systems, delivery route optimization, and location-based apps that
      provide directions and estimated travel times.

**Minuses of Geocoding:**

- 1.  **Data Quality Issues:** Geocoding accuracy heavily relies on the
      quality of the underlying address data. Inaccurate or outdated
      address information can lead to geocoding errors.
- 2.  **Costs:** Geocoding services or software often come with
      associated costs, particularly for large-scale geocoding
      operations. These costs can include data licensing fees and usage
      charges.
- 3.  **Complexity:** Advanced geocoding tasks, such as reverse
      geocoding (converting coordinates to addresses) and batch
      geocoding, can be technically complex and may require expertise or
      specialized tools.

In summary, geocoding offers numerous benefits in terms of location
accuracy, spatial analysis, visualization, and navigation. However, it
also comes with challenges related to data quality, costs, and
complexity. Careful consideration of these factors is essential when
using geocoding in various applications.

**Do not geocode from Zip codes** There are several issues and
limitations associated with geocoding solely based on zip codes:

- Lack of Precision: Zip codes are designed to cover a group of
  addresses or an area, not specific points. Therefore, geocoding based
  solely on a zip code provides only an approximation of the location,
  often at the center or centroid of the zip code area. This lack of
  precision can be problematic for applications that require accurate
  coordinates.

- Zip Code Boundaries: Zip code boundaries can be irregular and may not
  align with natural or administrative boundaries. This means that
  geocoding based on zip codes can result in coordinates that do not
  reflect the actual geography of the area, leading to inaccuracies.

- Zip Code Changes: Zip code boundaries and assignments can change over
  time due to population growth, urban development, or administrative
  reasons. Geocoding based on outdated zip code data can lead to
  incorrect locations.

- Large Zip Codes: Some zip codes cover vast geographic areas,
  especially in rural regions. Geocoding to the center of such large zip
  code areas can be highly inaccurate for specific locations within that
  area.

- Overlapping Zip Codes: In some cases, zip codes may overlap with one
  another. Geocoding based solely on a zip code may not distinguish
  between the overlapping areas, leading to ambiguity.

- Urban Density: In densely populated urban areas, zip codes can be
  small and densely packed with addresses. Geocoding solely by zip code
  may still result in a lack of precision when trying to identify a
  particular location within a zip code.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Data

[`mysterycall_geocode()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall_geocode.md)
accepts a CSV file path. Under the hood it calls the Google Maps
Geocoding API via
[`ggmap::geocode()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ggmap/man/geocode.html) — the
same service AHRQ uses for practice-location geocoding. You will need a
Google Maps API key with the Geocoding API enabled; set it in your
`.Renviron` file:

    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIza...

**Deduplicate addresses before geocoding.** If 300 providers share 150
unique practice addresses, geocode the 150 unique addresses and join
back — this halves your API usage and cost.

``` r

roster <- readr::read_csv("providers.csv")

# Deduplicate: geocode each unique address once
unique_addresses <- roster |>
  dplyr::distinct(address, .keep_all = FALSE)

readr::write_csv(unique_addresses, "data/unique_addresses.csv")

geocoded <- mysterycall_geocode(
  file_path           = "data/unique_addresses.csv",
  google_maps_api_key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"),
  output_file_path    = "data/geocoded_unique_addresses.csv"
)
```

The output CSV adds `lon` and `lat` columns (decimal degrees, WGS84)
plus a `geocode_status` column (`"OK"`, `"ZERO_RESULTS"`, or
`"REQUEST_DENIED"`). Always inspect the status column before proceeding:

``` r

table(geocoded$geocode_status)
#> OK            ZERO_RESULTS
#> 147           3

# Rows with ZERO_RESULTS need manual address correction
failed <- geocoded[geocoded$geocode_status != "OK", ]
```

### Step 3: Extract lat / long and rejoin to the full roster

The geocoded result has one row per unique address. Rejoin to the full
provider roster with
[`mysterycall_safe_left_join()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall_safe_left_join.md)
so every provider row gets coordinates, and so any address-matching
failures are visible rather than silent.

``` r

# Rename output columns to match the isochrone workflow expectation
geocoded_clean <- geocoded |>
  dplyr::filter(geocode_status == "OK") |>
  dplyr::rename(lat = lat, long = lon) |>
  dplyr::select(address, lat, long)

roster_geocoded <- mysterycall_safe_left_join(
  left         = roster,
  right        = geocoded_clean,
  by           = "address",
  label_left   = "provider_roster",
  label_right  = "geocoded_addresses",
  min_coverage = 0.97   # flag if > 3 % of providers have no coordinates
)
```

### Step 4: Extract coordinate columns when needed

Some downstream functions
(e.g. [`create_isochrones_for_dataframe()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md))
expect separate numeric `lat` and `long` columns rather than an `sf`
geometry column. If you are working with an `sf` object, extract
coordinates with:

``` r

roster_geocoded <- roster_geocoded |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    lat  = sf::st_coordinates(.)[, "Y"],
    long = sf::st_coordinates(.)[, "X"]
  )
```

### Common address formatting issues

Google’s geocoder is tolerant but some patterns fail consistently:

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|----|----|----|
| Suite/unit in wrong position | `"Suite 200, 123 Main St"` | Move to end: `"123 Main St Suite 200"` |
| Missing state | `"123 Main St, Denver"` | Append state: `"123 Main St, Denver, CO"` |
| PO Box | `"PO Box 1234, Denver CO"` | Use physical address instead |
| Abbreviation mismatch | `"St." vs "Street"` | Standardize before geocoding |
| ZIP+4 format | `"80202-1234"` | Truncate to 5-digit ZIP |

**Do not geocode from ZIP codes alone.** ZIP-code centroids place
practices at the post-office, not the clinic — a meaningful spatial
error that compounds in the isochrone step.

## Conclusion

[`mysterycall_geocode()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall_geocode.md)
converts raw practice addresses into latitude/longitude coordinates
suitable for mapping, drive-time modeling, and spatial joins. Combine it
with `mysterycall_search_by_taxonomy()` to build a fully enriched
provider roster — from NPI retrieval through geocoded locations — in a
single reproducible pipeline. Next, pass the geocoded file into
[`create_isochrones_for_dataframe()`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/mysterycall-deprecated.md)
to build drive-time polygons (see
[`vignette("create_isochrones", package = "mysterycall")`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/articles/create_isochrones.md)).
