# Search NPI Database by Taxonomy

This function searches the NPI Database for healthcare providers based
on a taxonomy description. The NPI API returns at most 1\\200 records
per query. To retrieve all providers for a large specialty, supply a
character vector of state abbreviations via the `states` argument; the
function will loop over each state and combine the results, effectively
bypassing the 1\\200-record cap.

## Usage

``` r
mysterycall_search_taxonomy(
  taxonomy_to_search,
  states = NULL,
  city = NULL,
  limit = 1200L,
  write_snapshot = TRUE,
  snapshot_dir = NULL,
  notify = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- taxonomy_to_search:

  A character vector containing the taxonomy description(s) to search
  for.

- states:

  Optional character vector of two-letter US state abbreviations (e.g.
  `c("CO", "CA", "NY")`). When supplied the search is repeated for each
  state so that all providers are captured even for large specialties
  that exceed the 1\\200-record per-query limit. Pass all 50 state
  abbreviations to perform a complete national search. Defaults to
  `NULL` (national search, capped at `limit` records).

- city:

  Optional city name passed to
  [`npi::npi_search()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi/reference/npi_search.html).

- limit:

  Maximum records to request per API call. Capped at 1\\200 by the NPI
  API. Defaults to `1200L`.

- write_snapshot:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, the retrieved data is saved as an `.rds` file for
  later reference. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- snapshot_dir:

  Directory where snapshot files should be written when `write_snapshot`
  is `TRUE`. Defaults to a session-specific folder inside
  [`tempdir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html) when not supplied.

- notify:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, play a notification sound when processing
  completes (requires the optional `beepr` package). Defaults to `TRUE`.

## Value

A data frame with filtered NPI data based on the specified taxonomy
description.

## Output columns

The function retains a curated subset of the columns returned by
[`npi::npi_flatten()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi/reference/npi_flatten.html).
The following column categories are **always dropped** regardless of
what the NPI API returns: all `endpoints_*` fields, all `other_names_*`
fields, all `identifiers_*` fields, supplementary address fields
(`addresses_address_2`, `addresses_fax_number`,
`addresses_address_type`, `addresses_country_code`), and several basic
and taxonomy metadata fields (`basic_last_updated`, `basic_status`,
`basic_name_prefix`, `basic_name_suffix`, `basic_certification_date`,
`taxonomies_code`, `taxonomies_taxonomy_group`, `taxonomies_state`,
`taxonomies_license`). To access dropped columns, call
[`npi::npi_search()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi/reference/npi_search.html)
and
[`npi::npi_flatten()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi/reference/npi_flatten.html)
directly.

## Contract

**Inputs:**

- `taxonomy_to_search` must be an exact NUCC taxonomy description string
  (see
  [`mysterycall::taxonomy`](https://mufflyt.github.io/mysterycall/reference/taxonomy.md)
  dataset for valid values).

- NPI registry API must be reachable; the function retries up to 3 times
  with exponential back-off before returning an empty data frame.

**Guarantees:**

- Returns a zero-row data frame (never `NULL`) when no records are
  found.

- Output rows are deduplicated on NPI.

- When `write_snapshot = TRUE`, an `.rds` file is written to
  `output_dir` for reproducible re-runs without re-querying the live
  API.

**Fails if:**

- Network is unavailable after all retries (returns empty data frame,
  does not error).

- `states` contains an invalid two-letter abbreviation (silently
  skipped).

## Performance

O(t \* p / 200) HTTP requests where `t` = number of state batches and
`p` = max_records (default 1,200). Each page request targets \< 200
rows. Full national search across all 50 states for one taxonomy takes
~2–5 min depending on registry load. Results are cached in-memory per
session when `use_cache = TRUE`.
