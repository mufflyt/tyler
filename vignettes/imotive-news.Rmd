## Overview

The **Imotive** initiative combines tyler's provider roster tooling with
streamlined QA helpers so field teams can run end-to-end mystery caller studies
with less manual coordination. This vignette summarises the highlights from the
latest development cycle and surfaces the helpers that changed.

## End-to-end orchestration

The `run_mystery_caller_workflow()` wrapper continues to be the recommended entry
point for Imotive projects. Recent documentation improvements clarify how it:

- Pulls and deduplicates provider rosters via `search_by_taxonomy()` and
  `search_and_process_npi()`.
- Validates NPIs with `validate_and_remove_invalid_npi()` before call prep
  begins.
- Produces Phase 1 workbooks by pairing `clean_phase_1_results()` with
  `split_and_save()` so teams can distribute assignments quickly.
- Normalises follow-up logs through `clean_phase_2_data()` and saves QA snapshots
  using `save_quality_check_table()`.

Each step now has linked references back to its standalone documentation so
callers can drill into the underlying helpers when needed.

## Data enrichment and validation

To support richer reporting downstream, the vignette highlights companion tools
that pair naturally with the workflow:

- `retrieve_clinician_data()` for importing CMS Care Compare demographics and
  practice affiliations.
- `genderize_physicians()` for backfilling gender information from the
  Genderize.io API while respecting daily rate limits.
- `geocode_unique_addresses()` to convert deduplicated practice locations into
  latitude/longitude for mapping or travel-time modelling.

Surfacing these touchpoints alongside the workflow helps teams decide which
optional enrichments to run before distributing call lists.

## Coverage monitoring

Field supervisors can keep tabs on geographic coverage with
`states_where_physicians_were_NOT_contacted()`. The vignette outlines how to pass
in the full list of expected states so the summary correctly flags untouched
regions. Pair it with the QA export generated by `save_quality_check_table()` to
triage follow-up calls.

The Imotive vignette will continue to summarise high-level updates each time new
features land in the development branch.
